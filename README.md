One of the main areas of improvement I see for the user interface of my car is more precise information about fuel consumption.
It keeps and displays a sliding average of miles per gallon, but whether it averages by gallons, miles, or hours is not known nor is the size of the window.
A feature I have seen in other cars is a bar graph showing average miles per gallon in 5 minute increments, with older averages on the left and younger on the right
The size of the window and the number of bars could be customizable in some way.
Another issue is that the number of marks on the fuel gauge does not correspond to an even multiple or fraction of the number of gallons that the tank can hold.
This presents a problem when trying to estimate the price of filling the tank, or how much a given sum of money will fill the tank.
The car does display the estimated number of miles that it can drive, which means it is capable of digitally measuring the gas level in the tank.
